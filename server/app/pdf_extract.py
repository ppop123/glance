"""Extract readable paragraphs from a PDF. Tuned for academic papers.

Backend: PyMuPDF (fitz). We previously used pdfminer.six but its layout
analyzer mangled math-prose paragraphs — equations rendered across
multiple lines would get spliced INTO the surrounding sentence in the
wrong order, producing un-translatable "by a factor of 𝑛 hc ×𝑑 be the
where 𝑑 is the hidden size..." soup. PyMuPDF uses the same MuPDF layout
engine that Chromium / Safari preview uses, and reads the source
paragraph in its natural left-to-right, top-to-bottom flow even when math
spans multiple visual lines.

Returns a flat list of Paragraph(page, text, bbox, page_height). Figures,
equations, and headers/footers are best-effort filtered by short-line +
repeat-line heuristics — the same downstream consumers
(detect_figure_crops / detect_noise_paragraphs) work unchanged."""
